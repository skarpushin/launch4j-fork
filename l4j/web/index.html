<h2>Cross-platform Java executable wrapper</h2>
<p>
    Launch4j is a cross-platform tool for wrapping
    Java applications distributed as jars in lightweight Windows
    native executables. The executable can be
    configured to search for a certain JRE version or
    use a bundled one, and it's possible to set
    runtime options, like the initial/max heap size.
    The wrapper also provides better user experience
    through an application icon, a native pre-JRE
    splash screen, and a Java download page in case
    the appropriate JRE cannot be found.

	for your system or compiling them. If you'll provide these, I'll be able to create a binary package
